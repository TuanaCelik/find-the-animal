Tiliqua scincoides (common blue-tongued skink, blue-tongued lizard, common bluetongue) is a species of skink. It is native to Australia as well as to the Tanimbar and Babar Islands in the Maluku Province of Indonesia.


== Subspecies ==
There are three subspecies:
Tiliqua scincoides scincoides – eastern blue-tongued skink (southern/eastern Australia)

== Description ==
This is a large terrestrial lizard measuring up to 60 centimetres long and 1 kilogram in mass. It has a stout body and short legs. It is variable in color but generally has a banded pattern. The tongue is blue-violet to cobalt blue in color. Due to its characteristic blue tongue and its curious nature, it is a popular companion animal in Western countries.This lizard is diurnal, active during the day. It is omnivorous, feeding on insects, snails, frogs, other reptiles, small birds, small mammals, carrion, some plant material, fruits, and fungi. It is ovoviviparous, the eggs hatching inside the female's body; she then gives birth to 5 to 25 live young per litter. This species is known to live over 30 years. It is an adaptable animal, often finding habitat in urban and suburban areas, including residential areas of Sydney. The lizard is considered beneficial in these areas, with its appetite for garden pests such as slugs and snails.When threatened it may hiss and reveal its blue tongue, startling potential predators.
There are three color-morphs of Tiliqua scincoides: albino, wild-type, and melanistic.  In warm environments, the wild-type T. scincoides and melanistic T. scincoides have skin with lower reflectance compared to the albino T. scincoides, therefore these two lizards can warm their bodies at a faster rate.
