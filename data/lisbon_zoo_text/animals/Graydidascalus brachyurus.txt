The short-tailed parrot (Graydidascalus brachyurus) is the only species of the genus Graydidascalus. It is found along both banks of the Amazon river and other major Amazonian rivers in Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. As suggested by its range, it is associated with the specific forest and woodland types growing near major rivers, although it also extends into the coastal deltas of French Guiana and Amapá, Brazil.
The closest relative is the yellow-faced parrot (Alipiopsitta xanthops) and the members of the genus Pionus.


== Description ==
It has a total length of about 24 cm (9+1⁄2 in). It is overall green with a large dark bill (large even for a parrot) and, as suggested by its name, a very short tail. Adults show a small maroon-red spot on the shoulder and at the base of the outer tail-feathers, but typically neither are easy to see.


== Conservation ==
The species is considered safe at the moment.
