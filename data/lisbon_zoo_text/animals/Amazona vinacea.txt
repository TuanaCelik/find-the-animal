The vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea) is a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is found in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, and plantations. It is threatened by habitat loss.
The species is currently endangered and is also prevented from nesting due to competition with the African Queen Bees (Apis mellifera scutellata), an invasive species spread throughout South and Central America. The invasive species compete with the endangered species for nesting boxes, mostly cavities in trees, occupying them first or invading the other specie nests.
